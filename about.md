Some information about you!

### More Information

I'm Alex! I grew up in Markham, Ontario and I currently go to school at NYU Stern where I study Business and Computer Science. Here are a few facts about me:
- I'm a HUGE sports fan. The Blue Jays and Raptors are my teams (Kawhi smiled at me once).
- I take lots of pictures and videos (Mostly with my phone but I'm trying to learn how to use my Nikon D3500 more).
- I eat a ton of food. Like a ton of food. My metabolism is pretty sweet.
- I'm basically lactose intolerant, but I still love cheese. Especially cheese curds in poutine.
