# Blog Post 12: Group Progress and In-Class Progress Update

This past week, we did a quick update in class summarizing our time so far contributing to the CAGOV design system open source project. We shared our progress including Jay Li's pull request made regarding changes to the design documentation, Javier's work on allowing animations to work without javascript, and my merged pull requests regarding the statewide header and adding links to images. We also shared positives about the project such as the responsiveness of the team and their willingnes to help us. We also shared negatives such as the lack of documentation and overall messiness with ticket organization.

Personally I am working on tying up 1 last pull request I've made regarding a dropdown animation and focusing on preparing for the final presentation.
