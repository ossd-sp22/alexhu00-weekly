# Blog Post 9: Reflection on California Design System Project Meeting

This week in class we began doing work on our open source project, the California Government Design System Project. The first main issue we ran into was trying to run the project locally as it was not doing anything after running “npm run dev”. In hindsight, we should have made sure we could run the project locally before we chose the project. Luckily we were able to troubleshoot the issue we were running into which was simply a matter of clicking on the generated link to the local address after running “npm run dev”. From here we spent time familiarizing ourselves more with the repo. I found it most helpful personally to run the site, then use inspect to determine which elements were linked to which files. As well, I also made another branch and played around with different SCSS values to help me familiarize myself with SCSS since I had only used CSS previously while this project mainly used SCSS.

After class, we also each took some time to look through some of the issues that Aaron Hans, a member of the Office of Digital Innovation and the top contributor to the project, suggested we take a stab at in his email. I specifically took a look at issue 764 which was related to making the images in the secondary card components on the website also clickable. This seemed like a rather straightforward task so I took a stab at it and was able to figure out that the website’s card components were mainly controlled by two .njk files. I was then able to edit those files by adding <a> tags with hrefs around the <img> and/or svg components to make the images clickable and sent a pull request ahead of our meeting with Aaron on Friday.

On Friday, our team had the opportunity to hop on a call with Aaron and Kimberly Gail, a lead visual designer for the project. In this meeting, we were each able to introduce ourselves and it was exciting to see how excited Aaron and Kimberly were to have us contributing. Specifically they expressed how they’ve been wanting to put more emphasis on adding documentation to open up the project more to external contributors. Aaron was also able to walk through the overall structure of the codebase and running tests which was very helpful and Kimberly was able to show us a Figma file while explaining how lots of design and color contrast designs are still being made to adhere to accessibility standards. Our next steps include sending a weekly status update email to Aaron and Kimberly to show them our progress and also to have Aaron review my pull request and send instructions on using Codepen to suggest improvements. As well, we will also wait on Kimberly to send us a copy of her Figma file so we can also potentially make non-code contributions regarding design decisions and documentation.
