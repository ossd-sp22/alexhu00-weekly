# Last Week of Class

During this last week of class, we got the chance to view the rest of our classmates presentations on their open source projects. We saw One Army, two Blender groups, Zulip, Spicetify, and more Oppia groups. 

The One Army group explained how One Army is a platform for numerous environmental projects such as Precious plastic.

The Blender groups explained their struggles with ramping up on the 3D rendering software so they could understand the project. One group actually created a 3D donut with the software to better understand it first.

The Zulip group (Zulip is a messaging software) talked about their struggles with the large community even though it looked like they had lots of support for new open source contributors. 

The Spicetify group talked about their design and theme changes and how they created a theme where the play button is on the very right and where lyrics are in a smaller font so they are a bit more readable in 1 line versus being cut up into multiple lines. I thought this group was the most interseting personally as I enjoyed hearing about their rationale behind certain design suggestion and changes.

The Oppia groups lastly did more complaining about the lack of support and length of time needed for tests and builds to run.
